# Server Mobs

## About
Server Mobs is a server-side mod for fabric 1.18.2 that creates new mobs, and provides a framework for other mods to do so.
At some point in the future, the non-API portion will be split into a separate mod. (Coming Soonâ„¢)

## Setup
Don't forget to configure polypack_host if you use it.
<br>
Example entity implementations are under [com.slimeist.server_mobs.entities](src/main/java/com/slimeist/server_mobs/entities).
The 'API' (not guaranteed to be stable yet) is under [com.slimeist.server_mobs.server_rendering](src/main/java/com/slimeist/server_mobs/server_rendering).
